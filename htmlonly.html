            Howdy! Welcome to my page! My name is Mahika Peri and I am a student at Texas A&M University in the College of 
            Engineering pursuing my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and a Minor in Business. I was born in Pennsylvania but moved to my hometown The Woodlands, TX 
            when I was 6 years old and have been living here ever since. A big reason why I chose Texas A&M was its proximity to home and therefore 
            how familiar it felt. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I graduated from The Woodlands High School in 2021 and began my college career soon after.
            My admission to Texas A&M Engineering was not finalized yet since I was accpeted through the 
            Texas A&M Engineering at Blinn Program (TEAB). This meant that on top of normal ETAM, I had to 
            take some classes at A&M and some through Blinn College at Rellis Campus in order to transfer 
            fully to A&M campus the following year. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I worked hard throughout my freshman year and was able to recieve admission to the Department of 
            Computer Science & Engineering before my Sophomore year. Since then, I have had the oppoprtunity to 
            work with a number of different languages, assist in the development of many projects, and gain an overall
            better understanding of Computer Science and its effect in the modern world.
            <br>
            <br>
            I hope to graduate in 2025 with an even better understanding of this field and more experience under my belt as I prepare to enter the job market. I hope this website is able to offer you some valuable insight into my interests, experiences, and goals for the future, as well as help you get to know my personality a bit better in regard to the ways I would like to give back to the world that has given me so much.
